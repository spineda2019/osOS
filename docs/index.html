        <p>Welcome! This is the landing page for the documentation of my osOS kernel
            pet project. <br /> <br />
            The docs themselves are generated by the zig build system,
            this page is just a landing page to glue them all together in one neat
            home since there is architecture specific code for each architecture's
            entry point. Here they are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="x86/index.html">x86 Kernel Documentation Home Page</a></li>
            <li><a href="RISC-V32/index.html">RISC-V32 Kernel Documentation Home Page</a></li>
            <!-- Add more links as needed -->
        </ul>
        <p>
            Of course, if you would like to check out the source, you can check out
            the repo hosted on github:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/spineda2019/osOS">Source Repo</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Github stars are appreciated! But of course, they are not required.
        </p>

        <h1>osOS is Free Software!</h1>
        <p>Although this is just a pet project, osOS is still free software licensed
            under the GPL v3 (or later). This is due in part because I like the
            GPL, and also because the kernel ships with GPL binaries. If I wrote/created
            a file/source code, it's GPLv3. No ifs, ands, or buts. They should all have
            the license notice, but just in case, here's what the notice actually look like:
