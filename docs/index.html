    <h1>osOS Documentation</h1>
    <p>Welcome! This is the landing page for the documentation of my osOS kernel
        pet project. <br /> <br />
        The docs themselves are generated by the zig build system,
        this page is just a landing page to glue them all together in one neat <br />
        home since there is architecture specific code for each architecture's
        entry point. Here they are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="x86/index.html">x86 Kernel Documentation Home Page</a></li>
        <li><a href="RISC-V32/index.html">RISC-V32 Kernel Documentation Home Page</a></li>
        <!-- Add more links as needed -->
    </ul>
    <h1>osOS is Free Software!</h1>
    <p>Although this is just a pet project, osOS is still free software licensed
        under the GPL v3 (or later). This is due in part because I like the <br />
        GPL, and also because the kernel ships with GPL binaries. If I wrote/created
        a file/source code, it's GPLv3. No ifs, ands, or buts. They should all have <br />
        the license notice, but just in case, here's what the notice actually look like:
