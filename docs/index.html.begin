            Welcome! This is the landing page for the documentation of my osOS kernel
            pet project.
        </p>
        <p>
            Checkout the README file in the
            <a href="https://github.com/spineda2019/osOS">source repo</a> for
            a view into the goals and reasoning behind this project. Spoiler
            alert: it's fun and educational!
        </p>
        <p>
            The docs themselves are generated by the zig build system,
            this page is just a landing page to glue them all together in one
            neat home since the kernel has many different modules, each with
            different generated docs and their own home page. Even this page
            is pieced together with
            <a href="https://github.com/spineda2019/osOS/tree/main/docs">zig code</a>!
        </p>
        <p>
            Each entry point module also has some architecture
            specific modules they use. Those will also have their own
            documentation home page. Those listed under "CommonModules" can
            be used by any architecture.
        </p>
